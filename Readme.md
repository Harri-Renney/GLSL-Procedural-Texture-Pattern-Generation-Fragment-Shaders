# Collection of Procedural Fragment Shaders

### Brief Description
The idea here is that each fragment shader is completely self contained, providing all the functions in the file to achieve the desired pattern.

### Format of Files.
* Fragment shader inputs from vertex shader.
* Fragment shader output. Typically just the pixel colour.
* Any expected uniforms that should be set outside the fragment shader. (If any present, likely required to be filled for shader to work as expected)
* Defines.
* Functions used from other peoples work with credit given.
* General purpose functions (Likely found across multiple files)
* Pattern specific functions
* The main, demonstrating each of the pattern functions.
